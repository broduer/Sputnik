This example is a very basic Hotline compatible (to a degree remember BASIC) server that can let (most) clients join and begin chatting.

This demonstrates a BASIC yet practical way of using the sockets.

Note that the server doesnt take into acount users leaving the server etc it is just a basic example.

This has better protocol implementation than the client does and is more accurate.
It was going to be used as Plugin for Pitbull Server Beta18 to allow Hotline clients to join.
However that was scrapped since I made Javaline server instead which fully supports Hotline just to be multiplatform.
