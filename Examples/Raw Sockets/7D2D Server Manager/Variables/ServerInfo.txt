Here are the changes on the server:
* You can mine Copper & Tin and combine them into Brass
* Many new crafting recipes such as Clay, Paper, Calipers, Flashlight etc
* Some crafting changes like Blunderbuss uses cloth instead of paper
* Major boost to Vitamins and Antibiotics
* Honey no longer cures infection
* Casio coins are Brass
* Moldy Bread can be crafted from old sham sandwiches
* Nails are now crafted in batches of 10 not 1
* Nailgun repairs all health per shot due to a bug in the game that makes repairing use more resources than making a new block so this change to nailgun should make it be the same both ways of course without a nailgun your upgrades are expensive so find one!
* Gas Recipe can be boosted with oil
* Many other changes you will have to find out... And more will be added over time
