This example is the final version of the old GUI builder for Sputnik.

It is the same thing the IDE.exe is compiled from.

It uses the SpuntikOldGui.dll so make sure to have that handy.

It was created a LONG time ago back when the first Sputnik GUI system was made and got updated along the way.

It can produce simple but effective GUIs for macros/scripts/trainers and simple apps.

It is not meant to be a 100% complete GUI framework like QT or something rather it is just an easy GUI builder for making simple apps/trainers etc.

Here is the full source code to the GUI Builder (IDE) to demonstrate yet another example of a large project made in Sputnik.

Finally this GUI Builder was never *completed* there was to be over 50 more controls, toolbars to left of the IDE and a lot more properties etc.

However it does what it does and it does it fairly well at some point I will probably make a new GUI framework or bind to something like QT who knows.

If you feel like making your own GUI framework then check out how the plugins work in the Embedded folder and create a GUI plugin!.

The next GUI framework should be properly object based and not rely on stuff like GUIGetProp() etc.
