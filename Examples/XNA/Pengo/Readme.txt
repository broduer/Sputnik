This is the final Sputnik version of the Pengo game I made.

Here is the newest Pengo after it was ported to C#:
http://ubersoft.org/pengo/

This game serves to demonstrate how to make a Pengo style game in Sputnik.

The game is full object-oriented and quite well made and is really the best way to make games.

This pengo is playable and has proper sounds and music even AI, monsters, powerups etc etc.

Pengo.bat -- Play the game
PengoLevels.bat -- Generate a new Levels.spk for the game

Enjoy!
