This script can read .db files created from server indexing using

Pitbull Pro
http://ubersoft.org/pitbullpro/

A chat+file sharing program created by UberFoX.

This script will let you read a .db file and explore it using commands common in command prompt such as :

dir // list the current folder
cd // move into a folder or go back (use "cd .." without quotes to go back)
cls // clear the screen

This is not meant to be a super amazing script rather it just demonstrates classes+binary in reading complex data.
