What we have here is a trainer for the PSX version (ePSXe) of Resident Evil 3.

It is just a inv/chest editor.

For it to work its base address should be set to the address of the Inventory Slot 1 AMMO

This a very old trainer and does not use pointers etc (which would be best since then it wouldnt need an address)
