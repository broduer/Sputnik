This is a trainer for The Long Dark all it does is let the player teleport to various preset locations around the game.

It demonstrates how to use a CheatEngine script in Sputnik without the end user having CheatEngine installed.

Sputnik can execute CheatEngine scripts without CheatEngine using the SputnikAsm.dll which is bascially the AutoAssembler of CheatEngine in slimmed down .dll form for any language to use however I customized it for Sputnik and Sputnik has unique features just for using that .dll.
