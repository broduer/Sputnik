This example is my old Perfect World skill editor it allowed me and my server moderators to modify their skills such as
Add, Delete skills.

It can be used to add skills you normally can't get.

It was pretty popular at one time with a lot of people from many servers using this tool.

The SkillTable had to be created by hand by reverse engineering the game but once that was complete the editor itself could be made.

It includes an example character "char.txt" which can be loaded with "load char.txt" (without quotes) command.

The editor does things in ways that might seem odd but thats because at the time Sputnik didnt have the features to do it any other way.
