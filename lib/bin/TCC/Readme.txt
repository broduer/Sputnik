Tiny C Compiler

This C compiler is very very small it could even fit on a floppy disk.

The point of having it in the BIN folder is to allow you to write C .dlls and use them in Sputnik.

See the "C TestDLL" folder (In the Sputnik examples folder) for example of how to create and use a C/C++ DLL with Sputnik.

You dont have to use TinyC you can use any C/C++ compiler you want that produces DLL files.
